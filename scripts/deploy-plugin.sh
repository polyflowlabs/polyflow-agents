Deployed. Two things stand between this and working.

1. Enable it. A user plugin's Python is not imported until its name is in the
   `plugins.enabled` allow-list — an installed-but-not-enabled plugin running
   code at startup is the vector GHSA-mcfc-hp25-cjv7 closed.

     ssh HOST 'hermes plugins enable polyflow_agents_push'

2. Restart the processes that load it:

     hermes serve        hooks (approvals, clarify, artifacts) AND the
                         registration routes, which mount at import
     hermes gateway      the platform face (cron delivery only)

   `/api/dashboard/plugins/rescan` re-scans the plugin list and reloads
   JS/CSS, but `_mount_plugin_api_routes()` runs at module import, so a new or
   changed backend route needs the restart.

Then confirm both faces:

  ssh HOST 'hermes plugins list | grep polyflow'
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://HOST:9119/api/plugins/polyflow_agents_push/devices
